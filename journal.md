August 28th, 2025 : I am trying to stay ahead of the work a little so I will write in this a little early, Today i had quite a lot of trouble trying to push changes on local reposity to the remote one using the console, eventually I realized that I could just use VS code to push my changes, so that's what I did. I really need to check with the instructor to see what I did wrong so I don't have to keep using VS code in the future.
